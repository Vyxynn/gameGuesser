# Game Guesser

Game Guesser is a web-based game where players guess the name of a game based on a series of images. The game provides hints in the form of images, and players can earn points by correctly guessing the game with fewer hints.

## Features

- Multiple games with multiple images for hints
- Score tracking based on the number of hints used
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
